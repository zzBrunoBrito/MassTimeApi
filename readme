Hi, the main file is handler.js, masstime_api.js are functions i used to complete the task
I'm using axios to make http requests and lat and long values are hard coded(line 6 and 7 - handler.js)
The errors from MassTimes api are returned to the client, if the server dont responds a error is returned as well
I also added a serverless.yml file and configured it to expose this lambda as http endpoint and to run every 12 hours too
But i didn't actually deployed it, so this serverless.yml is just to show how i would manage lambdas, may need changes to a real deploy
To run it you can uncomment the lines 37, 38 and 39 of handler.js or if you have serverless framework installed:
sls invoke local --function get_churches

* Despite being a relatively simple task to complete, may it could be solved with a single file and no dependencies,
I tried to use a bit more complex solution to show things like lambda management with serverless framework,
consuming libs, error handling and simpler things like check if a value exists before manipulate it
so the code don't break when there are null values, for instance.
